               Caterpillar fungus, also known as Cordyceps sinensis
               is considered a medicinal mushroom that increases energy, 
               stimulates the immune system, and acts as an overall tonic 
               to the body. It is one of the more famous Chinese herbs, 
               but has only gained attention in the West over the last 
               few decades.

                In addition to its reported health benefits, this fungus 
                is known for its unique way of reproducing. It develops 
                inside insect larvae, killing and mummifying the remains 
                before popping out of the ground as a fruiting body.
