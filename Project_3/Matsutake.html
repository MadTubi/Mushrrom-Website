           <p>Originally from Japan, matsutake mushrooms (tricholoma 
            matsutake) grow wild in Japan, China, and Korea. The name 
            “matsutake” means “pine mushroom” in Japanese after the pine
             forests where these fungi grow. However, the mushroom is 
             threatened in Japan and Okinawa due to habitat loss from 
             development and nematodes in the soil, which attach the roots 
             of the trees these mushrooms need to grow.

            <h2 id ="morelH2">How to cook Matsutake</h2>
            <p>Before cooking, wipe down matsutakes with a damp paper towel 
                to remove any debris; avoid washing or submerging them in 
                water. Cut the fibrous caps and stems into thick cubes, 
                slices, or coins to retain flavor and texture. 

                Matsutakes can be prepared similarly to other specialty 
                mushrooms: steamed, sautéed, seared, roasted, grilled,
                 or in a clear broth. However, because the matsutake is 
                 so rare, expensive, and uniquely flavored, you’ll get
                  the most out of your investment if you treat them gently 
                  and let them play the starring role in whatever you’re 
                  cooking.
            </p>

                In Japan, matsutake mushrooms are traditionally used to 
                make matsutake gohan, a sought-after rice dish in which 
                the mushrooms are cooked together with rice in dashi 
                so the earthy, spicy flavor infuses the rice. They’re 
                also used in sukiyaki, a Japanese dish similar to a hot
                 pot in which ingredients are slowly simmered in flavorful 
                 broth in a heated vessel at the table.
