            <p>
                These mushrooms belong to the genus Armillaria, which is made up of 
                different species of parasitic fungi that love to feast on wood. 
                They cause a white rot in trees and plant roots that can be quite 
                destructive.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Some species in the Armillaria genus  are edible, some are
                 bioluminescent, and one colony is suspected to be the 
                 largest organism on the planet!

            <h2 id="morelH2">How to cook Honey Fungus</h2>
            <p>Yes, these mushrooms are edible. They have, as you can imagine, 
                a slightly sweet taste along with a chewy, first texture. A 
                species of honey fungus, Armillaria melleaYet despite the 
                appealing name, these mushrooms can also be slightly bitter 
                and are known to cause some gastric distress. That’s why 
                many people recommend parboiling them for one or two minutes 
                before cooking. Parboiling is the process of partially cooking
                 something in boiling water but removing it before it cooks 
                 all the way.
            </p>
             
            <p>To parboil honey fungus, fill a pot with water and bring it to a 
                boil. Toss in your mushrooms and let them cook for one minute, 
                two tops. Then drain them and run cold water over them so they 
                don’t cook further and become mushy.
                
                Parboiling removes some of the stomach irritants and
                 bitterness. After that they can be wiped off and sliced 
                 for cooking.
