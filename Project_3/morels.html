            <p>This is a Morel mushroom and is quite edible. Beware of false morels, 
                which includes a number of species that look similar but are actually
                 poisonous. False morels are reddish-brown to yellow in color, with
                  a cap that hangs to one side. They're also not hollow on the inside
                  , like real morels.

            <h2 id="morelH2">How to cook Morels</h2>
            <p>To prepare morels, clean them with cold water and dry quickly before 
                they soak up the water. Then, slice them up and cook them however 
                you choose — keep in mind morels shouldn't be eaten raw as they 
                can cause stomach cramps. It's best to cook morels simply so you 
                can truly savor their flavor. A simple sauté with butter will help 
                to best bring out the mushroom's unique qualities.
