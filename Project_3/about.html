    <h2>About the Author</h2>

    <p id="about">Hi, my name is Madison T and I am the creator of this website.
        I chose to create this website because I have always had an 
        interest in mushrooms. I was was told not to eat or touch 
        them even though they were growing in my front yard. Then 
        last week I watched a video on mushrooms and realized that even 
        the most harmless-looking ones can be poisonous! So, I wanted to
         create a website on mushrooms.  </p>
