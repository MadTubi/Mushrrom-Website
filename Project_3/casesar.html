                This mushroom was first described in 1772 by Giovanni Antonio 
                Scopoli and was initially named Agaricus caesareus. (Most of 
                the gilled mushrooms were included initially in the genus 
                Agaricus!) In 1801 Christiaan Hendrik Persoon transferred 
                Caesar's Mushroom to the new genus Amanita, renaming it 
                Amanita caesarea.

                Caesar's Mushroom is a highly-prized edible species and 
                is most valued when at the 'button' stage. Currently we 
                have no recipes of our own for this southern-European 
                species, but in Italy and Cicily Caesar's Musrooms are 
                known as Ovolo Buono and are simply sliced and rolled in
                 salt before being seasoned with lemon juice, olive oil 
                 and a little pepper.
