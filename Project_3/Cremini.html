            <p>This is a Cremini mushroom, also known as 
                Agaricus bisporus.Cremini, also known as 
                crimini mushrooms, are simply a different
                 strain than the white button. Developed 
                 by commercial growers, they are brown in
                  color and have a slightly deeper taste.

            <h2 id="morelH2">How to cook Cremini</h2>
            <p>A note on eating cremini, do be aware that Agaricus
                 bisporus contains small amounts of toxins (gyromitrin 
                 for example). These toxins are rendered to negligible 
                 levels by heat so always cook your mushrooms. Many sources
                  will tell you it’s safe to eat them raw, but the truth 
                  is it’s best to cook your mushrooms.
