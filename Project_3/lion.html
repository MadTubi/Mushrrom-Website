            <p>Lion's mane, also known as hericium erinaceus, is 
                one of the more interesting-looking types of mushrooms 
                out there. In place of the traditional mushroom cap is 
                a large clump of teeth, which are spine-like structures 
                a few millimeters long.
            </p>

            <p>
                The purpose of these teeth is to manufacture and release 
                spores, the “seeds” of a mushroom that allow the fungal 
                organism to reproduce.

            <h2 id="morelH2">How to cook Lion's Mane</h2>
           <p>
             When cooked, the lion’s mane has a seafood-like flavor without 
             being too overpowering. Many liken it to the taste of shrimp or 
             lobster. Thus if you love the taste of seafood but you’re a vegetarian
             or allergic to shellfish, try spicing up your next meal with lion’s
              mane.
            </p>
            
            <p>
             The trick to preparing all edible mushrooms in the Hericium genus
              is to cook them slowly. These are tough and watery mushrooms that
               need longer periods of heat to cook off moisture and make them chewy.
               The extra cooking time is well worth it.
            </p>
            
           <p>
            For the best flavor, heat a pan to medium-high to high heat. Add the 
            mushrooms, cover the pan, and cook until the water is cooked out and the
             mushrooms start to brown. Add a bit of oil or butter and salt and cook
              them until you’ve reached your desired crispiness.
