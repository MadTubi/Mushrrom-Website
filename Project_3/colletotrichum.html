                Colletotrichum orbiculare is a plant pathogen of melons and 
                cucumber. It causes the disease anthracnose that can effect 
                curcubits causing lesions on various parts of the plant. It 
                can effect cucumbers, melon, squash, watermelon and pumpkin, 
                especially when the weather is rainy, humid and warm. It can 
                be transmitted by seed as well as soil and survive between 
                crops. It is also spread by feeding cucumber beetles, 
                splashing water, tools and workers. Efforts to control the 
                fungus include the practice of rotating cucurbits out for a
                 2-year period, planting cultivars with resistance, burning 
                 infected crops and careful control of weeds. Chemical control
                  measures are also available.
