            <h2 id="morelH2">How to cook White Buttons</h2>
            <p>You can use these in almost any recipe. Go ahead and prepare
                 them in soups, stews, and stir frys. Use them as a flavorful
                  topping for meat, fish, poultry, or pizza. Marinate them. 
                  Skewer and grill them. Chop them up and use them in a mushroom 
                  duxelles recipe. Your imagination is the limit!

                Yet the easiest way to cook them is in a simple sauté. 
                By chopping them up and sautéing with a little oil that has
                 a high smoke point, you’re left with delicious little flavor 
                 bombs that you could add to any recipe.</p>
